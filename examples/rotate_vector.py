"""
Exemplify how a vector can be rotated in the plane.
Method: display one vector as a vector field, using quiver,
with a 1x1 cells in the grid and vanishing vectors except
at the first grid point (origin).
The example show how the quiver function can be used to
display single vectors in a coordinate system.
