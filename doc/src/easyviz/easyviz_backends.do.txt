As we have mentioned earlier, Easyviz is just a unified interface to
other plotting packages, which we refer to as backends. We have
currently implemented backends for Gnuplot, Grace, OpenDX, Matlab,
Matplotlib, Pmw.Blt, Veusz, VisIt, and VTK. Some are more early in
developement than others, like the backends for OpenDx and VisIt.

Because of limitations in many of the plotting packages, not all
features in Easyviz are supported by each of the backends.  Gnuplot
has (at the time of this writing) no support for visualization of 3D
vector fields, so this is of course not available in the Gnuplot
backend either.
 
Some supported visualization programs are commented on below.

__Gnuplot.__ Gnuplot is a command-driven interactive or scripted
plotting utility that works on a wide variety of platforms. Gnuplot
supports many types of plots in both 2D and 3D, including curve plots,
contour plots, vector plots, and surface plots.  3D scalar and vector
fields are not supported. To access Gnuplot from Python and send NumPy
arrays to Gnuplot, we use the Python module `Gnuplot`.


__Matlab.__ Many view Matlab as the de facto standard for making curves
and plots of 2D scalar/vector fields.


__Matplotlib.__ Matplotlib is now quickly gaining wide popularity in
the scientific Python community and has established itself as the de
facto standard for curve plotting and 2D contour and (recently) surface
plotting. The interface to Matplotlib is Matlab-insipired, and
different backends are used to create the plots: Gtk, Tk, WxWidgets
and many more.  (Since Easyviz and Matplotlib haver very similar
Matlab-style syntax, Easyviz is just a thin layer on top of Matplotlib
to enable Matplotlib to be used with the Easyviz unified syntax.)
Matplotlib is now a comprehensive package with lots of tuning
possibilities that Easyviz does not support - but one can fetch the
underlying Matplotlib from Easyviz and call all the functionality of
Matplotlib directly.


__Grace.__ Grace is a highly interactive curve plotting program on the
Unix/X11 platform which has been popular for many years. It does not
support 2D or 3D scalar or vector fields. However, it has a lot of
functionality for computing with curves and adjusting/fine-tuning
plots interactively.


__PyX.__ PyX is a Python package for the creation of PostScript and
PDF files. It combines an abstraction of the PostScript drawing model
with a TeX/LaTeX interface. Complex tasks like 2d and 3d plots in
publication-ready quality are built out of these primitives.


__Pmw.Blt.Graph.__ Pmw (Python Mega Widgets) extends the Tkinter
package with more sophisticated widgets, included an interactive
widget for curve plotting. This widget is based on the BLT package
(an extension of Tk written in C).
The BLT backend offers currenlty only basic plotting functionality.


__Veusz.__ From http://home.gna.org/veusz<Veusz homepage>: Veusz is a
GUI scientific plotting and graphing package. It is designed to
produce publication-ready Postscript or PDF output. SVG, EMF and
bitmap formats export are also supported. Veusz has a comprehensive
GUI and produces really high-quality plots.


__VTK.__ VTK (Visualization ToolKit) is a package primarily aimed at
visualizing 2D and 3D scalar and vector fields by a range of techniques.
VTK is used to achieve 2D and 3D visualizations of the same type as 
Matlab offers. However, VTK can do much more (although the Easyviz 
commands are restricted to what is typically offered by Matlab).
